=OPML Import=

The most RSS reader offers an OPML export. You can export all your feeds in a single XML File. This file can be imported in rsslounge. Open the menue on the header (right) and chose "OPML Import". rsslounge will import all feeds and reloads the page. Afterwards rsslounge will update all feeds. This first update needs a little bit more time than the further updates.

*Important:* The feed icons will be set after the first update of the feeds!


=Update via Cronjob=

For updating rsslounge feeds via cronjob point your cronjob to open 
    {{{http://<rsslounge url>/update/silent}}}
via wget or curl.


=After installation all looks weird=

Mac OS and Linux users must ensure that all files will be uploaded. Also the file .htaccess which is hidden by default on Unix based Systems.


=Password protected rss feeds=

You can also subscribe to password protected rss feeds. Just enter the username and passwort before the url:
    {{{http://user:password@example.com/rss}}}
    
    
=The page is empty or following php error occurs=
    {{{PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected T_CLASS in /home/bongzone/public_html/rsshat.com/application/models/settings.php on line 1}}}
Choose the binary upload in your FTP Client software.


=There are problems on the feed update process, where can I find more debug information?=

rsslounge offers an logging mechanism which can be activated via the configuration file
    {{{config/config.ini}}}
Change there the option
    {{{logger.level = ALERT}}}
to
    {{{logger.level = DEBUG}}}
Then you can find detailed information about an cronjob or ajax update in the log file:
    {{{data/logs/default}}}
    
    
=I only get an ServerError 500=

This error occurs especially on Apache 1. Insert in the 
    {{{.htaccess}}}
following line bellow "RewriteEngine on"
    {{{
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /path/to/rsslounge/
    }}}
