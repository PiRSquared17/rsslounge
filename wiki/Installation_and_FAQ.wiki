=OPML Import=

The most RSS reader offers an OPML export. You can export all your feeds in a single XML File. This file can be imported in rsslounge. Open the menue on the header (right) and chose "OPML Import". rsslounge will import all feeds and reloads the page. Afterwards rsslounge will update all feeds. This first update needs a little bit more time than the further updates.

*Important:* The feed icons will be set after the first update of the feeds!


=Update via Cronjob=

For updating rsslounge feeds via cronjob point your cronjob to open 
    {{{http://<rsslounge url>/update/silent}}}
via wget or curl.


=After installation all looks weird=

Mac OS and Linux users must ensure that all files will be uploaded. Also the file .htaccess which is hidden by default on Unix based Systems.
